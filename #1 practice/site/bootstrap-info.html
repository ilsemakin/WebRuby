    <h1>Hayabusa-2: Spacecraft's 'bomb' crater found</h1>
    <p>
      The Hayabusa-2 spacecraft has sent back images of the crater made
      when it detonated an explosive charge next to the asteroid it is investigating.
    </p>
    <p>
      On 5 April, the Japanese probe released a 14kg device packed with plastic
      explosive towards the asteroid Ryugu.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blast drove a copper projectile into the surface, hoping to create a 10m-wide depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scientists want to get a "fresh" sample of rock to help them better understand
      how Earth and the other planets formed.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Hayabusa-2 has now taken pictures of the area below where the "small carry-on impactor" (SCI)
      device was to have detonated, and identified a dark disturbance in which fresh material has been
      excavated from beneath the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scientists working on the Japanese Aerospace Agency (Jaxa) mission said the blast area on
      the surface measures about 20m in diameter - twice the size of the crater they expected to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mission's official account tweeted: "We did not expect such a big alteration,
      so a lively debate has been initiated in the project!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the debris that would have been thrown up in this event,
      Hayabusa-2 manoeuvred itself before the detonation to the far side
      of 800m-wide Ryugu - out of harm's way and out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>But the probe left a small camera behind called DCAM3 to observe the explosion.</p>
    <p>
      Hayabusa-2 later returned to its "home position" about 20km above the asteroid's surface.
      From here, it conducted a search for the crater produced in the explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In coming weeks, scientists will command the probe to descend into
      the crater to collect its fresh samples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because they will come from within the asteroid, they will be less
      altered by the harsh environment of space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bombardment with cosmic radiation over the aeons is thought to change
      the surfaces of these planetary building blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryugu belongs to a particularly primitive type of space rock known as a C-type asteroid.
      It's a relic left over from the early days of our Solar System, and therefore records
      the conditions and chemistry of that time - some 4.5 billion years ago.
