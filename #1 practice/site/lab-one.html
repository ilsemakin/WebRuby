    <h1>Samsung's folding phone debacle is a credibility blow it can hardly afford</h1>
    <p>
      The delayed launch of Samsung’s Galaxy Fold,
      the groundbreaking foldable phone that was due to go on sale this week,
      is far from the most embarrassing moment in the company’s recent history.
    </p>
    <p>
      That unwanted honour goes to the catastrophe that was 2016’s Note 7,
      a device that received rave reviews right up until the point that they began bursting into flames.
      Unforgivable battery defects, which had not shown up in testing,
      meant the phones were prone to overheating, grounding flights and injuring children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samsung was forced into two recalls of the Note 7 before finally ending production completely.
      In a poetic coda, the factory that produced the batteries itself caught fire.
      The whole episode was estimated to have cost it more than £4bn.
    </p>
    <p>The Galaxy Fold, which was indefinitely delayed on Monday, is not quite in the same bracket.</p>
    <p>
      The faults that have emerged in recent days - such as flickering and unreliable screens,
      and unsightly bulges in the folds of the display - are uncomfortable, but not a biological hazard.
      The phone had not yet made it into the hands of the public:
      its problems emerged when reviewers received their devices ahead of its launch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The device was also unlikely to sell in high numbers.
      Its £1,800 price point and slightly janky appearance made sure of that.
      The financial burden of delaying the phone will be minor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for a company that prides itself on innovation, the reputational blow is severe.
      When Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Fold in February,
      it presented it as the biggest change in smartphones in a decade.
      DJ Koh, the head of Samsung’s mobile division, instructed us to “get ready for the dawn of a new era”.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in theory, he was right.
      Folding phones are a potential game-changer for what has become the single most important device in our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Galaxy Fold’s dual-screen design - one tablet-sized display that closes in on itself like a book,
      and a second exterior one for use when it is folded - promised to breathe new life into an increasingly-unexciting
      smartphone market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samsung, which for years struggled to shake off its reputation as an Apple copycat,
      was the first major smartphone manufacturer to announce a folding phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huawei has already followed, and there is no doubt that Apple is thinking about it.
      But this was undoubtedly Samsung’s chance to hog the innovation limelight at a time
      when Apple’s recent cancellation of its AirPower wireless charging mat suggests the
      iPhone maker is struggling to push engineering boundaries.
